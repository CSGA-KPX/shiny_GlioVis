For GBM subtyping we have now switched to the latest classification from the Verhaak lab with 3 classes (Classical, Mesenchymal and Proneural). Please check
[Wang Q. et al. 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076) for details. 4 classes subtyping will be still available as "Subtype_Verhaak_2010".      

**Updates**   
+ Agilent-4502A and RNA-seq data are now availble for the TCGA GBM dataset.   
+ Mutations are now available also for the TCGA Pan-Glioma dataset.  

**New datasets**   
We have included 3 new datasets for adult gliomas and 10 for pediatric brain tumors.

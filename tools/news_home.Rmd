**New features** 
  + Differential gene expression analysis for Microarray datasets.   
  + Oncoprints for the TCGA mutation data.   
  + Dataset download tab: it's now possible to dowload a full dataset as a .txt file.   
  
**Updates** 
  + TCGA datasets have been updated to the 21-08-2015 data freeze.   
  + Rppa data are now available also for the TCGA GBMLLGG dataset.   
  + New gene list, the LM22 ([Newman AM. et al. 2015](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822800)), for deconvolution analysis.  
  + Mutations data for TCGA sudies are now downloaded from the cBio Portal. 
  + In survival and correlation analysis it's now possible to specify subtypes, when available, for all histologies and not only for GBMs.

ESTIMATE (Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data) is a tool for predicting tumor purity, and the presence of infiltrating stromal/immune cells in tumor tissues using gene expression data. ESTIMATE algorithm is based on single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and generates three scores:   

1. stromal score (that captures the presence of stroma in tumor tissue),     
2. immune score (that represents the infiltration of immune cells in tumor tissue), and    
3. estimate score (that infers tumor purity).

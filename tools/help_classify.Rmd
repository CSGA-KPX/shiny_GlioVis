**GBM**   
For the GBM subtype classification we use 4 subtypes (Classical, Mesenchymal, Neural, Proneural) as defined in [Verhaak RG. et al. 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20129251).   
   
**LGG**  
For the LGG subtype classification we use 4 subtypes (1 to 4) as defined in [NEJM](https://#)         
   
Classification algorithms:      
* The Subtype call generated by **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, is done performing a linear Kernel with 10-fold cross validation, using the `ksvm` function of the [‘kernlab’](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab/kernlab.pdf) package. As training dataset for the GBM we use the TCGA GBM samples described in [Brennan C. et al. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24120142). As training dataset for the LGG we use the TCGA LGG samples described in [NEJM](https://#)         
* The **K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)** Subtype calls, are obtained using the `knn` function of the [‘class’](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/class/class.pdf) package, using the subtypes as in the SVM calls.  
* The Subtype call generated  by single sample **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA)**, is done using the `gsva` function of the [‘gsva’](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.12/bioc/html/GSVA.html) package. For GBM samples classification we uses the 840 gene classifier as defined in [Verhaak RG. et al. 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20129251). Not available yet for LGG samples.   

The "3-Way" tab (GBM samples only) generates Subtype calls with the tree methods (SVM, K-NN and ssGSEA) and compare them, giving a "majority vote". In case the three methods give three different outputs for a specific sample, the vote will be assigned arbitrary (by alphabetical order).

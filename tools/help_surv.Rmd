**Median**: split in two groups by the median (`quantile(mRNA)[2]`)   
**Lower quartile**: split in two groups, 25% lower expressing vs the rest (`quantile(mRNA)[1]`)   
**Upper quartile**: split in two groups, 25% higher expressing vs the rest (`quantile(mRNA)[3]`)   
**High vs low**: split in two groups, 25% lower expressing vs 25% higher expressing   
**Quartiles**: split in 4 groups (`quantile(mRNA)`)   
**Use a specific mRNA value**: manually select a precise mRNA value

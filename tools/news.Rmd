* **Updates** 
  + For GBM subtyping we have now switched to the latest classification from the Verhaak lab with 3 classes (Classical, Mesenchymal and Proneural). Please check
[Wang Q. et al. 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076) for details. 4 classes subtyping will be still available as "Subtype_Verhaak_2010".  
  + Agilent-4502A and RNA-seq data are now availble for the TCGA GBM dataset.   
  + Mutations are now available also for the TCGA Pan-Glioma dataset.      

* **New datasets**   
  + We have included 3 new datasets for adult gliomas and 10 for pediatric brain tumors. 


**18-03-2016**  

* **New datasets**   
  + We have included 12 new datasets for pediatric gliomas.  

**02-02-2016**  

* **Updates**
  + TCGA GBMLGG (Pan-Glioma) subtyping and clustering have been updated accordingly to the recent publication in _Cell_ ([Ceccareli et al. 2016](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824661)).  


**15-01-2016**  

* **New features**  
  + Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis for the results of differential gene expression analysis.  
  
* **Updates**
  + DeconvoluteMe: user can now specify any gene sets in [MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp).  
  

**27-11-2015**   

* **New features** 
  + Differential gene expression analysis for Microarray datasets.   
  + Oncoprints for the TCGA mutation data.   
  + Dataset download tab: it's now possible to dowload a full dataset as a .txt file.   
  
* **Updates** 
  + TCGA datasets have been updated to the 21-08-2015 data freeze.   
  + Rppa data are now available also for the TCGA GBMLLGG dataset.   
  + New gene list, the LM22 ([Newman AM. et al. 2015](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822800)), for deconvolution analysis.  
  + Mutations data for TCGA sudies are now downloaded from the cBio Portal. 
  + In survival and correlation analysis it's now possible to specify subtypes, when available, for all histologies and not only for GBMs.
